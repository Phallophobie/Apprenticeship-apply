First of all I searched for someone, who could help me with this homework.
We decided, to use Java as a programming language, because it is very versatile an works on almost every device.
At first we tried to solve the task with arrays and for loops.
Then we discovered the "charAt()" function and implented it in the first for loop.
After that we needed an array, which registers, which letters are missing.
At last we build a "while loop" around the code, to allow reusabilty.
