Jana Ferbitz //  Pangramm Checker
Hello and welcome to my pangram checker.

It is very easy to use this program.
Just enter your choosen sentence and the pangram checker will check it.
Should one or more letters be missing for a pangram, the program will tell you which are missing.
To exit this program, you just need to write a "Z" and thats it - but watch out! The z has to be a big letter to exit.
